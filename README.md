# Agile Learning

This project is about my own style of [agile learning](notes/961174eb_agile_learning.md). This repo is essentially an essay documenting my processes as I develop them, except that I have not cast the ideas into a linear format. I am using the Zettelkasten method. Ideas are connected wiki-style, with links.
