# bdeba9ab Context Switching

In learning, context switching is a form of friction. To avoid this friction, find a way to externalize your context in a given subject so you can pick it up again when you come back to that subject. Consider using some kind of [Context Board](8bae751e_context_board.md) for this. See [Notetaking](1ec8f6a4_notetaking.md).
