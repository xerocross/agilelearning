# 4d3ef3a9 Kanban

Kanban is a system for pulling [stories](30cc55ee_story.md) through production as needed. (See also [just-in-time learning](a1638acb_JIT_learning.md). My Kanban system for learning is inspired by the way kanban is done in software development. In this system, a Kanban is basically a card with a story written on it. A Kanban system is a system for displaying these cards and keeping track of where they are in process from backlog, to-do, through in-progress and then done. The goals here are to aid visibility of the learning program as a whole, to prioritize stories by ordering the backlog, and to see that stories flow through the process smoothly. The implementation could be sticky notes on a wall or sophisticated software for keeping track of the stories.
