# 9d04737b Tangential notes

When studying using the [raw slips method](2a54e5ab_studying_with_raw_slips.md), it is 
useful to capture any tangential thought that is not about the subject at hand. Capture these 
thoughts on slips to be processed [however you process notes](1ec8f6a4_notetaking.md). The 
important point here is _not to ignore these ideas_ for the reason that they are not on
topic.
