# 90a0f4fe The 80-20 Rule

The 80-20 rule says that 80% of the value comes from 20% of the product. This applies
to [agile learning](961174eb_agile_learning.md) as we try to find and prioritize the 20%. Compare 
with [getting fast feedback from sprints](3ddb2bf8_sprints_are_for_fast_feedback.md) and [just-in-time learning](a1638acb_JIT_learning.md).
