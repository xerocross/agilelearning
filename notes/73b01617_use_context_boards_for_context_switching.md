# 73b01617 Use context boards for context switching

I believe one of the main benefits of
See [taking notes](1ec8f6a4_notetaking.md) is to reduce the friction of [context switching](bdeba9ab_contextswitching.md), thereby improving [flow](865e156b_flow.md).
For example, as you finish studying a given topic for the day, you can create a 
[context board](8bae751e_context_board.md) just for that particular learning session representing what you studied, what you learned, what you were thinking about during that session. Then when you pick up the subject to study again, review the most recent context board to prime your mind to pick up where you left off. For this reason, a context board need not be a comprehensive summary of an entire session's learning. Context boards are not intended to be used as [reference notes](a33cf63e_reference_notes.md).
