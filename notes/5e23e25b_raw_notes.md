an event to be studied. They are called "raw" as distinct from notes that have been formally 
introduced into some kind of [notetaking](1ec8f6a4_notetaking.md) system. Compare [studying with raw slips](2a54e5ab_studying_with_raw_slips.md). A raw note may or may not be a [sllp note](8ea67041_slip_note.md).
