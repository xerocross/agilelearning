# e235b9f6 Learning requires special considerations

Since [learning is not manufacturing](1288482d_learning_is_not_manufacturing.md) or IT, it stands to reason that learning may require considerations completely
outside of anything that has been considered for agile, devops, lean, etc., in the business world. Also, some of the ideas from those areas may not translate or
may in fact work against the goals of learning. Example: [learning requires constant maintenance](2049fa7a_learning_requires_maintenance.md).
