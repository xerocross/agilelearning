# 865e156b Flow

We might think of flow as the opposite of friction. Smooth flow with minimal
waste is a major goal of [agile](961174eb_agile_learning.md) as a whole and the [kanban](4d3ef3a9_kanban.md) system in particular. [Context
switching](bdeba9ab_contextswitching.md) is an example of friction that impedes flow. A goal of studying flow is to identify [rate-limiting constraints (aka bottlenecks)](915ef070_bottleneck.md). See [how](27b71238_how_does_flow_identify_bottlenecks.md)?
