# 233864f3 Test-Driven Learning

This technique is inspired by test-driven development, and by the scrum practice of writing
user stories with clearly defined acceptance criteira. For each object of study, one should
brainstorm a [story](30cc55ee_story.md) that has clearly-defined acceptance criteria---that is, a clear and concise way to test whether one has successfully completed this learning objective.
