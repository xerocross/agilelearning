# e33be859 Sprints

In Scrum-based software development, a "sprint" is a pre-defined cycle during which some demonstrable unit of product will be brought through development to completion enough for demonstration and receiving feedback. At that point the unit will be demonstrated to stakeholders. This allows for [fast feedback](3ddb2bf8_sprints_are_for_fast_feedback.md).

In the context of self-directed learning, it is not enough to arbitrarily divide time into two-week "sprints" to mimic Scrum. We must ask [what is a sprint in agile learning](b2126c36_what_is_a_learning_sprint.md)?
