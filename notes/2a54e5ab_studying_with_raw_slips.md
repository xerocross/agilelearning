# 2a54e5ab Studying with raw slips

One method of taking notes while studying is to keep a blank stack or pad
of [small slips](8ea67041_slip_note.md) of paper nearby while studying, and to write [raw notes](5e23e25b_raw_notes.md) on these
slips _one idea at a time_. After a session, then you have a stack of raw notes to be
organnized into any useful [notetaking](1ec8f6a4_notetaking.md) system. Example: [write a context board](896bb83f_raw_notes_to_context_board.md). Note also the value of
[tangential notes](9d04737b_tangential_notes.md).
