# 961174eb Agile Learning

Agile learning is a method of self-directed learning that is inspired by
Agile practices in software development, including the specific methods
companies have designed to suit the overall idea of what "Agile" means.
Thus, it incorporates ideas from Scrum and [kanban](4d3ef3a9_kanban.md) and also freely pulls inspiration
from various other methodologies that can be applied to self-directed learning, such
as [stories](30cc55ee_story.md) and [Test-Driven Learning](233864f3_test_driven_learning.md).

A major goal of "agile" learning is [flow](865e156b_flow.md).
