# 7a2a761d Automated Testing

In the software world, a test is a bit of code that runs to check whether a program (other code) is functioning correctly. In the context of learning, such a test could be a simple quiz question or the front and back of a flashcard. We _automate_ these tests whenever possible, meaning that the tests run at intervals automatically or every time the base code changes.

One way to apply this idea to agile learning is to use flashcards in a spaced-repetition program to encourage long-term memory of items learned.
