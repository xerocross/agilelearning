# 7a2a761d Automated Testing

In the software world, a test is a bit of code that runs to check whether a program (other code) is functioning correctly. In the context of learning, such a test could be a simple quiz question or the front and back of a flashcard. We _automate_ these tests whenever possible, meaning that the tests run at intervals automatically or every time the base code changes. Compare [spaced repetition flashcard program](7df7859d_spaced_repetition_flashcard_program.md).
