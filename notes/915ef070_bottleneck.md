# 915ef070 Bottleneck

In the sense of [flow](865e156b_flow.md) and [agile](961174eb_agile_learning.md), by "bottleneck" we mean the rate-limiting constraint. Among the various constraints slowing
the flow of agile learning, there must be one that is _most_ impeding progress. Removing such
a bottleneck would therefore instantly improve the rate of learning, in which case there 
would by definition now be a new, different bottleneck.
