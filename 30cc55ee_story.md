#30cc55ee Story

A story is a clear and concise learning objective written usually 
in a particular format of the form "as a ... I want to .... so that ...". For
example, I might write, "As a Java developer, I want to learn the basics of working
with threads, so I can talk about them intelligently in interviews." See also (Test-Driven 
Learning)[233864f3_test_driven_learning.md].
